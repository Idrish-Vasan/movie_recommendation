# Movie Recommendation System

## Project Overview
This project implements a content-based movie recommendation system that analyzes movie features such as genre, cast, and director to suggest similar movies to users. The system utilizes natural language processing techniques to provide accurate recommendations.

## Technical Details

### Implementation
The project uses Python with specialized NLP and data processing libraries:
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import difflib
from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity
```

### Features
- Content-based movie recommendations
- Advanced text processing using TF-IDF
- Similarity calculation using cosine similarity
- Fuzzy string matching for movie titles
- Top 30 movie suggestions

### System Components
The recommendation engine processes data through:
1. Text vectorization of movie features
2. Similarity matrix calculation
3. Movie matching and ranking
4. Sorted recommendation generation

## Usage Instructions

### Setup
1. Install necessary packages:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the recommendation system:
```bash
python movie_recommendation_system.py
```

### Data Requirements
The system requires a CSV file containing movie information with columns for:
- Movie title
- Genre
- Cast
- Director
- Keywords
- Tagline

## Recommendation Process
The system follows these steps:
1. Processes movie features using TF-IDF vectorization
2. Calculates similarity scores between movies
3. Matches user input with movie database
4. Generates top 30 similar movie recommendations

## Applications
This system is ideal for:
- Streaming platforms
- Movie databases
- Content recommendation services
- Personal movie discovery

## Future Development
Planned enhancements include:
- Hybrid recommendation system implementation
- Enhanced matching algorithms
- User interface development
- Performance optimization
